salt-decoupled
==============

I have decided to build out two seperate Salt State repositories in order to accomplish things in different ways. This repository represents the way I initially decided to build out my Salt environment with the following goals in mind:
 * Ease of use
  * All states should be written using YAML/JINJA to make it easy for other users to follow / re-write (Although I am thinking of optimizing these using straight Python)
 * De-coupled build
  * I am trying to write these states to focus on "loosely coupled" systems such as cloud systems

Thanks and hope this helps
